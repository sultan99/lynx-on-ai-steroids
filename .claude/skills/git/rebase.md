# Git Rebase

Rebase current branch onto another branch.

## Steps

### Step 1: Fetch and rebase

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/<branch-name>   # default: main
```

### Step 2: Resolve conflicts (if any)

1. **Analyze both sides:**
   - Ours (HEAD) = your implemented changes
   - Theirs (incoming) = changes from target branch

2. **Resolve wisely:**
   - Keep your implementation logic intact
   - Integrate incoming changes (imports, renamed functions)
   - If code was refactored → apply your changes to new structure
   - If both modified same logic → combine intentions, prefer cleaner solution

3. **After resolving:**
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **If stuck:** `git rebase --abort` and ask for help.
